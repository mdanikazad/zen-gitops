## 1. Core Concepts — Quick Reference

### The Two Pillars of Observability

| Pillar | Tool | What it answers |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Logs** | Fluent Bit → Elasticsearch | *What happened?* — errors, events, messages |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus → Grafana | *How is it performing?* — CPU, memory, request rates |

> A complete observability stack adds **Tracing** (e.g. Jaeger/Tempo) as the third pillar — not covered in this branch but expect it to come up.

## 2. Fluent Bit

### Q: What is Fluent Bit and why use it over Fluentd or Logstash?

**Answer:**
Fluent Bit is a lightweight, high-performance log processor and forwarder written in C. It is designed for constrained environments like containers and edge devices.

| | Fluent Bit | Fluentd | Logstash |
|-|-----------|---------|----------|
| Language | C | Ruby | JVM |
| Memory footprint | ~1 MB | ~40 MB | ~500 MB+ |
| CPU | Very low | Medium | High |
| Plugin ecosystem | Good | Excellent | Excellent |
| Recommended use | Kubernetes DaemonSet (edge) | Aggregator tier | Heavy ETL |

In this project Fluent Bit runs as a **DaemonSet** (one pod per EKS node) because it needs to read log files directly from the node filesystem at `/var/log/containers/`. Its low footprint means it does not compete with application pods for resources.

---

### Q: Walk me through the Fluent Bit pipeline in this project.

**Answer (five stages):**

```
/var/log/containers/*.log   (every container on the node)
        │
        ▼
[INPUT: tail]
 - Reads new log lines using inotify
 - Tracks read position in a SQLite DB (survives pod restarts)
 - Parses Docker/CRI log format (JSON wrapper + actual log line)
        │
        ▼
[FILTER: kubernetes]
 - Calls the Kubernetes API to enrich each record with:
   pod name, namespace, labels, annotations, node name
        │
        ▼
[FILTER: grep]
 - KEEPS only records where namespace == "dev"
 - DROPS records from the fluent-bit pods themselves
   (avoids recursive log loops)
        │
        ▼
[FILTER: lua]
 - Reads the pod's "app" label (e.g. "api-gateway")
 - Sets _service_name = "api-gateway" on each record
        │
        ▼
[OUTPUT: elasticsearch]
 - Ships over TLS to Elastic Cloud endpoint
 - Authenticates with an API key (from a Kubernetes Secret)
 - Logstash_Prefix_Key _service_name
   → creates one daily index per service:
     api-gateway-2026.05.19
     auth-service-2026.05.19
```

---

### Q: Why does Fluent Bit run as a DaemonSet and not a Deployment?

**Answer:**
Container logs are written to the **node's local filesystem** at `/var/log/containers/`. A Deployment would schedule pods on arbitrary nodes and could not guarantee coverage of every node. A DaemonSet guarantees **exactly one Fluent Bit pod per node**, so every node's logs are collected. Each pod mounts the host path read-only:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: varlog
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log
```

---

### Q: How does Fluent Bit authenticate to Elastic Cloud?

**Answer:**
The API key is stored in a Kubernetes Secret (`fluent-bit-elastic-credentials`) and injected as an environment variable into the DaemonSet. The ConfigMap references it via `${ELASTIC_API_KEY}`:

```
Secret (base64-encoded api_key)
  → mounted as env var ELASTIC_API_KEY in the DaemonSet pod
    → referenced in fluent-bit.conf: api_key ${ELASTIC_API_KEY}
```

The API key is **never stored in Git** — the Secret is created imperatively with `kubectl create secret`. This is a standard secret hygiene pattern in GitOps: manifests reference secret names, not values.

---

### Q: What RBAC permissions does Fluent Bit need and why?

**Answer:**
The Kubernetes filter needs to call the Kubernetes API server to enrich log records with pod metadata. The ServiceAccount needs:

```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "namespaces", "nodes"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Without this, the Kubernetes filter falls back to parsing metadata from the log filename only (which is less reliable). A ClusterRole is used (not a namespaced Role) because Fluent Bit collects logs from all namespaces and needs to look up pods cluster-wide.

---

### Q: How does Fluent Bit avoid shipping its own logs to Elasticsearch?

**Answer:**
A `grep` filter drops any record where the Kubernetes `pod_name` label matches the Fluent Bit DaemonSet pod name pattern. In this project:

```ini
[FILTER]
    Name    grep
    Match   *
    Exclude $kubernetes['namespace_name'] fluent-bit
```

Without this, each Fluent Bit log line about "shipped a log line" would itself generate a new log line — causing a recursive feedback loop that would overwhelm Elasticsearch.

---

### Q: What is the Lua filter doing in this pipeline?

**Answer:**
The Lua script (`service_index.lua`) extracts the service name from the pod's `app` label and sets it as `_service_name`. This field is then used by the OUTPUT plugin as the Elasticsearch index prefix:

```lua
function set_service_name(tag, timestamp, record)
    local app = record["kubernetes"]["labels"]["app"]
    if app then
        record["_service_name"] = app
    end
    return 1, timestamp, record
end
```

This means each service gets its own daily index (`api-gateway-2026.05.19`) instead of everything landing in one giant index. This makes Kibana searches faster and enables per-service index lifecycle policies.

---

### Q: What happens if Fluent Bit cannot reach Elasticsearch?

**Answer:**
Fluent Bit has a built-in **retry mechanism** with exponential backoff. Failed records are buffered in memory (or on disk if configured). By default:

- `Retry_Limit 5` — retry up to 5 times before dropping
- The SQLite DB tracks the tail position, so after a restart Fluent Bit resumes from where it left off — no log loss

For production, set `storage.type filesystem` and configure a `storage.path` on a PVC to survive pod restarts with large backlogs.

---

## 3. Elasticsearch & Kibana

### Q: What is Elasticsearch and how does it store logs?

**Answer:**
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search engine built on Apache Lucene. Logs are stored as **JSON documents** in **indices**. Each document is a single log line enriched with metadata.

In this project, one daily index per service:
```
api-gateway-2026.05.19  →  all api-gateway logs from today
api-gateway-2026.05.18  →  all api-gateway logs from yesterday
```

Elasticsearch inverts the text (tokenises, stems, indexes every word), which is why full-text search across millions of logs is fast.

---

### Q: What is an Elasticsearch Index Template and why does it matter?

**Answer:**
An index template defines the mapping (schema) and settings applied automatically to new indices that match a name pattern. Without a template, Elasticsearch uses dynamic mapping — it guesses field types. This can cause issues:

- A field that sometimes has `"200"` (string) and sometimes `200` (integer) causes a **mapping conflict**
- You cannot aggregate on a `text` field — you need a `keyword` sub-field

Best practice: define an index template before Fluent Bit starts shipping:

```json
PUT _index_template/pharma-services
{
  "index_patterns": ["*-service-*", "api-gateway-*"],
  "template": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "log": { "type": "text" },
        "level": { "type": "keyword" },
        "kubernetes.pod_name": { "type": "keyword" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Q: What is the difference between `text` and `keyword` in Elasticsearch?

**Answer:**

| Type | Analysed? | Use for | Supports |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `text` | Yes — tokenised, lowercased | Full-text search (`log`, `message`) | `match`, `multi_match` |
| `keyword` | No — exact string | Filtering, aggregations, sorting | `term`, `terms`, `aggs` |

Rule of thumb: use `keyword` for log levels, pod names, status codes. Use `text` for the log message body itself. Many fields get both via `fields.keyword`.

---

### Q: How would you search for all 500 errors from the api-gateway in the last hour in Kibana?

**Answer:**
In Kibana Discover, using KQL (Kibana Query Language):

```kql
kubernetes.labels.app : "api-gateway" AND http.status_code : 500
```

Or with Lucene syntax:
```
kubernetes.labels.app:"api-gateway" AND http.status_code:500
```

Set the time filter to "Last 1 hour". The index pattern would be `api-gateway-*`.

---

### Q: What is Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)?

**Answer:**
ILM automates managing index age and size through phases:

```
Hot phase   → active writes, fast storage (SSD)
Warm phase  → less frequent queries, can reduce replicas
Cold phase  → rare access, cheap storage
Delete phase → delete after N days (e.g. 30 days)
```

In a production setup you would attach an ILM policy to the `pharma-services` index template so old log indices are automatically moved and deleted — preventing disk from filling up.

---

## 4. Prometheus

### Q: What is Prometheus and how does it collect metrics?

**Answer:**
Prometheus is an open-source time-series database and monitoring system. It uses a **pull model** — it reaches out and **scrapes** HTTP endpoints (`/metrics`) on a fixed interval (default 15s). This is the opposite of most older monitoring systems (Nagios, Graphite) which use push.

Why pull is preferred in Kubernetes:
- Prometheus knows exactly which targets it is scraping (and can tell if one disappears)
- No firewall rules needed for inbound connections to the monitored apps
- Scrape failures are immediately visible in Prometheus UI

---

### Q: What is the `/metrics` endpoint?

**Answer:**
It is a plain HTTP endpoint that exposes metrics in **Prometheus text format**:

```
# HELP http_requests_total Total HTTP requests
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{method="GET",status="200"} 1523
http_requests_total{method="POST",status="500"} 12

# HELP process_memory_bytes Memory in bytes
# TYPE process_memory_bytes gauge
process_memory_bytes 87031808
```

Any application can expose this — Spring Boot uses the `micrometer` library, Node.js uses `prom-client`. Fluent Bit exposes its own pipeline metrics at port 2020.

---

### Q: What are the four metric types in Prometheus?

**Answer:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Counter** | Monotonically increasing number, never decreases | `http_requests_total`, `errors_total` |
| **Gauge** | Can go up or down | `memory_usage_bytes`, `active_connections` |
| **Histogram** | Samples observations in configurable buckets | `http_request_duration_seconds` |
| **Summary** | Calculates configurable quantiles client-side | `rpc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"}` |

Key interview trap: **you never `rate()` a gauge** — only counters. Rate calculates the per-second increase, which is meaningless for a value that can go down.

---

### Q: What is a ServiceMonitor and a PodMonitor?

**Answer:**
Both are Kubernetes CRDs added by the kube-prometheus-stack operator. They tell Prometheus which endpoints to scrape without editing the main Prometheus config.

**ServiceMonitor** — targets a Kubernetes `Service`:
```yaml
kind: ServiceMonitor
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api-gateway
  endpoints:
    - port: http-metrics
      path: /metrics
```

**PodMonitor** — targets pods directly (used when there is no Service):
```yaml
kind: PodMonitor
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluent-bit
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - path: /api/v1/metrics/prometheus
      port: http
      interval: 30s
```

In this project `k8s/monitoring/fluent-bit-podmonitor.yaml` uses a PodMonitor because Fluent Bit's metrics port is not exposed via a Service.

---

### Q: What are these two flags in the Prometheus values and why are they needed?

```yaml
serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false
podMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false
```

**Answer:**
By default, kube-prometheus-stack only picks up ServiceMonitors/PodMonitors that have labels matching the Helm release label selector. Setting these to `false` makes Prometheus pick up **all** ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors across the entire cluster, regardless of labels.

Without this, the `fluent-bit-podmonitor.yaml` (which lives in the `dev` namespace and was not created by the monitoring Helm release) would be silently ignored.

---

### Q: What is the difference between retention time and retention size in Prometheus?

**Answer:**
Both are configured in this project:
```yaml
prometheusSpec:
  retention: 15d       # delete data older than 15 days
  retentionSize: "8GB" # delete oldest data when total exceeds 8 GB
```

Whichever limit is hit first triggers deletion. `retentionSize` prevents the PVC from filling up even if 15 days of data is less than 8 GB. The Prometheus data PVC (`prometheus-data`) is provisioned at 10 Gi, giving ~2 Gi headroom above the 8 GB cap.

---

### Q: What is kube-state-metrics and how is it different from Node Exporter?

**Answer:**

| | kube-state-metrics | Node Exporter |
|-|-------------------|---------------|
| Exposes | Kubernetes **object** state | Host hardware & OS metrics |
| Examples | Pod restarts, deployment replicas, PVC status | CPU %, disk I/O, network traffic |
| Installed by | kube-prometheus-stack (auto) | kube-prometheus-stack (auto, DaemonSet) |
| Talks to | Kubernetes API server | `/proc`, `/sys` on the host node |

Both are auto-installed by kube-prometheus-stack and auto-scraped by Prometheus.

---

## 5. Grafana & PromQL

### Q: What does Grafana actually store?

**Answer:**
Nothing. Grafana is a **pure visualisation layer**. It stores dashboard definitions (JSON) and data source config, but no metric data. When you open a dashboard:

1. Grafana reads the dashboard JSON (which contains PromQL queries)
2. Fires those queries at Prometheus
3. Prometheus queries its time-series DB and returns numbers
4. Grafana renders those numbers as charts

This is why a Grafana pod restart does not lose any data — all the data lives in Prometheus.

---

### Q: How are dashboards provisioned automatically in this project?

**Answer — two independent streams:**

**Stream 1 — sidecar (28 Kubernetes dashboards)**
```
ConfigMaps labelled grafana_dashboard: "1"
  → grafana-sc-dashboard sidecar container
    watches all namespaces every 60s
      → copies JSON to /tmp/dashboards/
        → loaded into Grafana live (no restart needed)
```

**Stream 2 — grafana.com download (Fluent Bit dashboard)**
```
prometheus-values.yaml: dashboards.default.fluent-bit.gnetId: 7752
  → init container fetches dashboard JSON from grafana.com at pod startup
    → written to /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/default/fluent-bit.json
      → loaded under the "Pharma" folder
```

The key difference: sidecar dashboards update live; provider dashboards only load on restart.

---

### Q: Write a PromQL query for HTTP error rate as a percentage.

**Answer:**
```promql
100 * (
  sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
  /
  sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
)
```

Breaking it down:
- `rate(...[5m])` — per-second rate over the last 5 minutes (smooths spikes)
- `status=~"5.."` — regex match for all 5xx status codes
- `sum()` — aggregate across all pods/instances
- Dividing numerator by denominator gives a ratio; multiply by 100 for percentage

---

### Q: What is the difference between `rate()` and `irate()` in PromQL?

**Answer:**

| | `rate()` | `irate()` |
|-|----------|-----------|
| Calculation | Average rate over the whole range | Rate of the last two data points only |
| Best for | Dashboards (smoothed trend) | Alerting (catches sudden spikes) |
| Handles counter resets | Yes | Yes |

Example: if a pod suddenly starts throwing 1000 errors/sec for 10 seconds then recovers, `rate()[5m]` shows ~33 errors/sec (averaged over 5 min), while `irate()[5m]` shows the peak spike.

---

### Q: Walk through the PromQL CPU usage query used in Node dashboards.

**Answer:**
```promql
100 - avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100
```

1. `node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}` — counter: total seconds the CPU spent idle
2. `rate(...[5m])` — converts to fraction of time idle per second (value between 0 and 1)
3. `avg()` — averages across all CPU cores
4. `* 100` — converts to percentage
5. `100 - ...` — inverts idle % to get busy (used) %

---

## 6. Alertmanager

### Q: What is the role of Alertmanager in the Prometheus stack?

**Answer:**
Alertmanager is responsible for **deduplication, grouping, silencing, and routing** of alerts. Prometheus evaluates alert rules and sends **firing alerts** to Alertmanager. Alertmanager then decides:
- Which receiver to notify (email, Slack, PagerDuty, webhook)
- How to group related alerts (e.g. all alerts from one cluster together)
- When to suppress repeated notifications (`repeat_interval`)
- Which alerts are silenced (maintenance windows)

This separation means Prometheus can fire raw alerts at high frequency, while Alertmanager prevents alert fatigue.

---

### Q: Explain the routing tree in Alertmanager.

**Answer:**
Routing is hierarchical. Every alert starts at the `route` root and cascades through child routes until one matches:

```yaml
route:
  receiver: "slack-low-priority"     # default: everything goes here
  group_wait: 30s
  repeat_interval: 12h
  routes:
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: "slack-sre-ops"      # critical alerts → #SRE_OPS channel
      continue: false                # stop matching after this route
    - match:
        alertname: AlertmanagerNotificationFailed
      receiver: "email-fallback"     # alertmanager failures → email
```

`group_wait: 30s` — wait 30 seconds to batch related alerts before sending the first notification.
`continue: false` — once a route matches, stop evaluating further routes (default behaviour).

---

### Q: What alert rules exist in this project and what do they fire on?

**Answer:**

**`crash-demo-alert.yaml`**
```yaml
alert: PodCrashLooping
expr: rate(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[5m]) > 0
for: 1m
labels:
  severity: critical
```
Fires when any pod has more than 0 restarts in the last 5 minutes, sustained for 1 minute. Designed for demo/testing of the Slack integration.

**`alertmanager-notification-failure-alert.yaml`**
```yaml
alert: AlertmanagerNotificationFailed
expr: increase(alertmanager_notifications_failed_total[5m]) > 0
```
Fires when Alertmanager itself fails to deliver a notification — a meta-alert that catches broken webhook URLs or Slack API failures. Critical for SRE on-call because a silent Alertmanager means you never know when something breaks.

---

### Q: What is the difference between `for` and `group_wait` in Alertmanager config?

**Answer:**

| Setting | Where | Controls |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `for: 1m` | Prometheus alert rule | How long the condition must be true before Prometheus sends the alert to Alertmanager |
| `group_wait: 30s` | Alertmanager route | How long Alertmanager waits after receiving the first alert before sending the notification (to batch related alerts) |

`for` prevents noisy alerts from flapping conditions (a pod that restarts once and recovers should not page anyone). `group_wait` prevents a flood of individual notifications when 10 pods crash simultaneously.

---

### Q: How would you set up a silence for a planned maintenance window?

**Answer:**
Via the Alertmanager UI or API:

```bash
# via amtool CLI
amtool silence add \
  --alertmanager.url=http://alertmanager:9093 \
  --author="jane.doe" \
  --comment="Planned maintenance - EKS node rotation" \
  --start="2026-05-20T02:00:00Z" \
  --end="2026-05-20T04:00:00Z" \
  alertname=~".*"
```

Or via the Alertmanager web UI: Silences → New Silence → add matchers → set time window.

---

## 7. Kubernetes Logging Architecture

### Q: How does Kubernetes handle container logs?

**Answer:**
Kubernetes itself does not ship logs. When a container writes to `stdout`/`stderr`, the container runtime (containerd/Docker) writes those lines to a log file on the **node's filesystem** at:

```
/var/log/containers/<pod-name>_<namespace>_<container-name>-<container-id>.log
```

This is a symlink to:
```
/var/log/pods/<namespace>_<pod-name>_<uid>/<container-name>/<sequence>.log
```

`kubectl logs` reads directly from these files via the kubelet API. Fluent Bit reads from `/var/log/containers/` with the `tail` input plugin.

When a pod is deleted, its log files are deleted too — this is why a log aggregation pipeline (Fluent Bit → Elasticsearch) is essential. Without it, logs disappear with the pod.

---

### Q: What are the two Kubernetes log collection patterns?

**Answer:**

**Pattern 1 — Node-level agent (DaemonSet)**
- One log collector pod per node
- Reads `/var/log/containers/` directly
- Lightweight, no sidecar overhead
- Used in this project: Fluent Bit DaemonSet
- Limitation: only collects stdout/stderr, not application log files inside the container

**Pattern 2 — Sidecar per pod**
- A second container in every pod shares a volume and tails log files
- Can collect application log files (not just stdout/stderr)
- Higher resource cost; harder to manage at scale
- Use when: apps write to files and cannot be reconfigured to log to stdout

---

### Q: What is log rotation in Kubernetes and why does it matter for Fluent Bit?

**Answer:**
The kubelet rotates log files when they exceed a size limit (configurable, default 10 MiB) or after a set number of rotations. When a file is rotated, the inode changes. Fluent Bit's `tail` plugin tracks file position by **inode** and handles rotation transparently — it detects the old inode disappearing and the new file appearing and picks up where it left off.

The SQLite DB (`/var/log/fluentbit-db/flb_kube.db`) persists positions across Fluent Bit pod restarts.

---

### Q: What log formats does Fluent Bit parse for Kubernetes?

**Answer:**
Two formats depending on the container runtime:

**Docker (older):**
```json
{"log":"2026-05-19 INFO api-gateway started\n","stream":"stdout","time":"2026-05-19T10:00:00Z"}
```

**CRI (containerd, used by EKS AL2023):**
```
2026-05-19T10:00:00.000000000Z stdout F 2026-05-19 INFO api-gateway started
```

Fluent Bit's built-in `cri` parser handles both. The `docker` parser handles the JSON wrapper. The Kubernetes filter further enriches with metadata from the Kubernetes API.

---

## 8. GitOps & ArgoCD for Observability

### Q: How is the observability stack deployed in this project?

**Answer:**
Everything is managed via ArgoCD:

```
k8s/monitoring/prometheus-values.yaml  ← all Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager config
        │
argocd/apps/dev/monitoring-app.yaml    ← ArgoCD Application that watches above
        │
ArgoCD syncs → runs:
  helm upgrade kube-prometheus-stack
  with those values
```

Similarly for Fluent Bit:
```
helm-charts-fluent-bit/  +  envs/dev/values-fluent-bit.yaml
        │
argocd/apps/dev/fluent-bit-app.yaml
        │
ArgoCD syncs → deploys Fluent Bit DaemonSet
```

This means every change to Grafana dashboards, alert rules, or Fluent Bit config goes through a Git PR — giving an audit trail, peer review, and rollback capability.

---

### Q: Why is the Elasticsearch API key stored as a Kubernetes Secret rather than in the Helm values file?

**Answer:**
Three reasons:
1. **Security** — secrets in Git (even base64-encoded) are visible to anyone with repo access and are captured in git history forever
2. **GitOps hygiene** — the `zen-gitops` repo is designed to be forked and shared; it must not contain real credentials
3. **Rotation** — when the API key expires, you update the Secret with `kubectl create secret ... --dry-run | kubectl apply` without touching Git or triggering an ArgoCD sync

The Helm chart references the secret by name. ArgoCD manages the Deployment/DaemonSet; the Secret is managed out-of-band (or via External Secrets Operator in a mature setup).

---

### Q: What is the External Secrets Operator and how would you use it here?

**Answer:**
The External Secrets Operator (ESO) syncs secrets from external vaults (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager) into Kubernetes Secrets. Instead of manually creating the Fluent Bit secret with kubectl, you would:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit-elastic-credentials
  namespace: dev
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secrets-manager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: fluent-bit-elastic-credentials
  data:
    - secretKey: api_key
      remoteRef:
        key: pharma/dev/elastic-api-key
```

ESO then automatically creates and rotates the Kubernetes Secret from AWS Secrets Manager. The `k8s/external-secrets/` directory in this repo already has the `ClusterSecretStore` setup.

---

## 9. Scenario-Based Questions

### Scenario 1: Logs stopped appearing in Kibana. How do you debug?

**Step-by-step answer:**

```bash
# 1. Check Fluent Bit pods are running
kubectl get pods -n dev -l app=fluent-bit

# 2. Check Fluent Bit logs for errors
kubectl logs -l app=fluent-bit -n dev --tail=50

# 3. Look for Elasticsearch output errors specifically
kubectl logs -l app=fluent-bit -n dev | grep -i "error\|failed\|rejected"

# 4. Check Fluent Bit metrics (if Prometheus is scraping it)
# In Grafana: look at fluentbit_output_errors_total

# 5. Check if the Elastic API key is still valid
# Go to Elastic Cloud console → API Keys → check expiry

# 6. Check if the network path to Elastic Cloud is open
kubectl exec -n dev -it <fluent-bit-pod> -- \
  curl -v https://97f1fa5d7d9d4d58ba3926dfb84ebeb0.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443

# 7. Check if new indices are being created in Elasticsearch
# Kibana → Dev Tools: GET _cat/indices?v&s=index

# 8. Check if only a specific service's logs are missing (index routing issue)
# or all logs (connectivity/auth issue)
```

Common root causes: expired API key, network policy blocking egress to Elastic Cloud, Fluent Bit OOMKilled (logs too large), wrong namespace filter.

### Scenario 2: Prometheus shows a target as DOWN. What do you do?

**Step-by-step answer:**

```bash
# 1. Check Prometheus Targets page
# http://prometheus:9090/targets  → find the red target, read the error message

# 2. Most common error: "connection refused"
# → the /metrics endpoint is not reachable
# Check if the pod is running and the port is correct
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n dev -o yaml | grep -A5 "ports:"

# 3. Error: "context deadline exceeded"
# → pod is running but /metrics is slow or hanging
# Test directly:
kubectl exec -n dev -it <prometheus-pod> -- \
  curl http://<pod-ip>:<port>/metrics

# 4. Check the ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor labels match
kubectl get servicemonitor -n dev -o yaml | grep -A5 "selector:"
# Ensure they match the pod labels

# 5. Check these flags are set in prometheus-values.yaml:
# serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false
# podMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false
```

### Scenario 3: Grafana dashboard shows "No Data". How do you debug?

**Step-by-step answer:**

1. Check the time range — is it set to "Last 5 minutes" but the metric only exists for the last hour?
2. Check the data source — is it pointing to the correct Prometheus instance?
3. Go to Explore mode → paste the PromQL query → run it manually
4. Check if the metric name exists: `{__name__=~"fluentbit.*"}` to list all Fluent Bit metrics
5. Check if Prometheus is actually scraping the target (Targets page)
6. Check the label selectors in the PromQL — the dashboard may be filtering on a label that doesn't exist in your cluster (e.g. `cluster="prod"` but you're in `dev`)

### Scenario 4: You are getting too many alert notifications. What do you change?

**Answer:**
Several levers in Alertmanager:

```yaml
route:
  group_wait: 30s          # increase to 2m to batch more before first notification
  group_interval: 5m       # how long to wait before sending an update to a group
  repeat_interval: 12h     # increase to 24h to halve notification frequency

# Add inhibition rules — suppress lower severity when higher is firing
inhibit_rules:
  - source_match:
      severity: critical
    target_match:
      severity: warning
    equal: [alertname, namespace]
```

Also consider:
- Increasing the `for` duration on alert rules to require longer sustained conditions
- Adding more specific `matchers` to route non-actionable alerts to a low-noise receiver
- Using Silences for known flapping alerts during investigation

---

### Scenario 5: A new service is deployed. What do you do to add it to the observability stack?

**Answer:**

**For metrics:**
1. Ensure the Spring Boot service exposes `/metrics` via Micrometer actuator
2. Create a `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` in the `dev` namespace
3. Commit to `zen-gitops` — ArgoCD syncs it; Prometheus picks it up within 60s
4. Create a Grafana dashboard ConfigMap labelled `grafana_dashboard: "1"` — sidecar loads it live

**For logs:**
- Nothing to do — Fluent Bit collects from all pods in the `dev` namespace automatically
- The Lua filter reads the `app` label and creates a new Elasticsearch index automatically
- Add a Kibana index pattern for the new service: `new-service-*`

## 10. System Design Questions

### Q: Design a logging pipeline for a 50-service microservices platform at 1M log lines/minute.

**Answer (sketch):**

```
Each EKS node
  └── Fluent Bit DaemonSet
       ├── Buffers to disk (not just memory) for backpressure
       └── Outputs to Kafka (not directly to Elasticsearch)

Kafka cluster (3 brokers, topic per env)
  └── Logstash / Kafka Connect consumers
       ├── Parse, enrich, filter
       └── Bulk index to Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch cluster (dedicated hot/warm/cold tiers)
  ├── Hot nodes (NVMe SSDs) — last 7 days
  ├── Warm nodes (HDDs) — 7-30 days
  └── Cold tier / S3 snapshot — 30-365 days

ILM policies auto-transition indices
```

Why Kafka in the middle:
- Decouples producers (Fluent Bit) from consumers (Elasticsearch)
- Elasticsearch backpressure during high load does not cause Fluent Bit to drop logs
- Multiple consumers can read from the same topic (analytics, alerting, archival)
- Replay capability if Elasticsearch is down

### Q: How would you implement log-based alerting (alerting on log patterns)?

**Answer:**
Two approaches:

**Option A — Elasticsearch → ElastAlert 2 (log-native)**
```
Elasticsearch → ElastAlert2 polls for query matches → Slack / PagerDuty
```
ElastAlert2 runs queries (e.g. `level:ERROR AND service:auth-service`) on a schedule and fires when match count exceeds a threshold.

**Option B — Loki + Grafana (metrics from logs)**
```
Fluent Bit → Loki (instead of/alongside Elasticsearch)
Loki → LogQL → Grafana Alerts → Alertmanager
```
Loki stores logs and exposes them via LogQL. Grafana can create alert rules on log queries (e.g. `count_over_time({app="api-gateway"} |= "ERROR"[5m]) > 10`). These feed into the same Alertmanager already running.

Option B integrates better with the existing Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager stack used in this project.

| What is the default Prometheus scrape interval? | `15s` |
| What format do Prometheus metrics use? | OpenMetrics / Prometheus text format |
| What is a label in Prometheus? | A key-value pair that adds dimensions to a metric |
| What does `rate()` do? | Calculates per-second increase of a counter over a range |
| What does `increase()` do? | Total increase of a counter over a range (rate × range seconds) |
| What does `sum by()` do? | Aggregates a metric summed by a label dimension |
| Can you rate() a gauge? | No — only counters (gauges can decrease) |
| What is a counter reset? | When a counter restarts from 0 (pod restart); `rate()` handles this |
| What is Loki? | Grafana's log aggregation system — indexes labels only, not log content |
| What is Jaeger? | Distributed tracing system (the 3rd observability pillar) |
| What is TSDB? | Time Series Database — how Prometheus stores metrics on disk |
| What does `on:` do in PromQL? | Joins two metrics on specific labels only |
| What is `absent()` used for? | Alert when a metric stops being reported (e.g. pod disappears) |
| What is a Grafana provisioning path? | File-based config loaded at startup; changes need a restart |
| What is the Grafana sidecar? | Container that watches ConfigMaps and loads dashboards live |
| How do you rotate an Elastic API key without downtime? | Create new key → update secret → rolling restart Fluent Bit DaemonSet |
| What is `retentionSize` in Prometheus? | Max disk usage before oldest data is deleted; prevents PVC full |
| What is `group_by` in Alertmanager? | Groups alerts with the same label values into one notification |
| What does `send_resolved: true` do? | Sends a follow-up notification when the alert stops firing |
| What is a DaemonSet good for? | Running exactly one pod per node — perfect for log collectors and metrics agents |

> **Interview tip:** When asked about a tool, always connect it to a real problem it solves. For example: "Fluent Bit runs as a DaemonSet because logs live on the node filesystem, and we need one collector per node to guarantee full coverage — a Deployment would leave some nodes uncovered."
